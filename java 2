Java interview question !! This is one of the interview question asked to me :)

Most of us will know, what is singleton class and how we can make a class singleton but do you know why we make a class singleton?ðŸ™„

For people who don't know, Singleton is a design pattern which ensures that class will have only one object.

How to make a class singleton?

1.Make its constructor private.
2.Write a static method that has the return type object of this singleton class.

Why we make class singleton?

âœ… The singleton class is used to control object creation and allows only one entry point to create the new instance of the class.

âœ… It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution.

âœ… A singleton class shouldnâ€™t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost.Thus, are used for logging, driver objects, caching, thread pool, database connections and sockets.
